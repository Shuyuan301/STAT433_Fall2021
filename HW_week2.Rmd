## Download Bridge Dataset in WI

**Firstly, I use Microsoft Excel to convert a txt file to an excel file.**
```{r}
library("readxl")
my_data <- read_excel("WI20.xlsx")
head(my_data)
colnames(my_data) #check column names and pick the variables I'd like to use
```
## Making a CSV File 

**Then, I made a csv file with Bridge ID, Built Year, County Code, Deck Condition Rating, Superstructure Condition Rating, Substructure Condition Rating, and Operating Rating.**

```{r}
df <- data.frame (col_1 = my_data['STRUCTURE_NUMBER_008'],
                  col_2 = my_data['YEAR_BUILT_027'],
                  col_3 = my_data['COUNTY_CODE_003'],
                  col_4 = my_data['DECK_COND_058'],
                  col_5 = my_data['SUPERSTRUCTURE_COND_059'],
                  col_6 = my_data['SUBSTRUCTURE_COND_060'],
                  col_7 = my_data['OPERATING_RATING_064'])

colnames(df) <- c('Bridge_ID','Built_Year','County_Code','Deck_Cond',
                  'Superstructure_Cond','Substructure_Cond','Operating_Rating')

write.csv(df,'WI_Bridge_data.csv')

```

```{r}
data = read.csv('WI_Bridge_data.csv')
head(data)
```

## Plotting

**I would like to figure out if there is any relationship between built year and operating rating.**

Plot by using ggplot:
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data, aes(x=Built_Year, y=Operating_Rating)) + geom_point(color='orange')+
  labs(x = "Built Year",y = "Operating Rating")
```
From the above plot, we can see that it seems the later the bridge is built, the higher the operating rating is.


**Also, I would like to check if there is any relationship between Deck condition rating and operating rating**
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data, aes( x=Deck_Cond, y=Operating_Rating)) + geom_boxplot(color='purple')+
  labs(x = "Deck Condition Rating",y = "Operating Rating")
```
From this plot, we can see that the bridges with deck condition rating larger than 6 got better median operating ratings than the bridges with deck condition rating below or equal to 5.

**Try to build a basic model to predict the operating rating by using condition ratings**
```{r}
data$Superstructure_Cond <- as.numeric(data$Superstructure_Cond)
data$Substructure_Cond <- as.numeric(data$Substructure_Cond)

mymodel = lm(Operating_Rating ~ Superstructure_Cond + Substructure_Cond, data = data)
summary(mymodel)
```
